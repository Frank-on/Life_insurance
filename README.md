# Project Title: Life Insurance Persistency Analysis
This project seeks to understand the factors influencing policy lapse rates and develop strategies to improve policyholder retention.

The dataset contains information on life insurance policies, including:

### Policy Information:
- Policy Number
- Risk Start Date
- Scheduled Due Date
- Sum Assured
- Annual Premium
- Policy Status
- Policy Type
- Booked Premium
- Expected Premium
- Customer Information:
- Customer Code
- Pay Rate
  
### Agent and Branch Information:
- Agent ID
- Manager ID
- Branch

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The analysis will commence with a deta cleaning and preparation process that includes hhandling of missing values, data formatting, outlier detection and feature engineering. 

### Handle Missing Values:
- Identify missing values and impute or remove them appropriately.
- Consider using techniques like mean, median, mode imputation or predictive modeling.
### Data Formatting:
- Ensure consistent data types (e.g., date, numeric, categorical).
- Format dates to a standardized format.
### Outlier Detection and Handling:
- Identify and address outliers using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
- Consider capping, flooring, or removing outliers.
### Feature Engineering:
Create new features that might be relevant to the analysis, such as:
- Policy Age
- Premium Payment Ratio
- Days Past Due
- Agent/Manager Productivity Metrics


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

### Univariate Analysis:
- Analyze the distribution of numerical variables (e.g., histograms, box plots).
- Explore categorical variables (e.g., bar charts, frequency tables).

### Bivariate Analysis:
- Examine relationships between variables (e.g., scatter plots, correlation matrices).
- Visualize the distribution of policy statuses over time.
- Analyze the impact of customer demographics and policy features on lapse rates.

## Persistency Modeling:

### Survival Analysis:
- Fit survival models (e.g., Kaplan-Meier, Cox Proportional Hazards) to estimate the probability of policy lapse over time.
- Identify key risk factors for policy lapse.

### Machine Learning:
- Use classification techniques (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost) to predict policy lapse.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Segmentation Analysis:

### Customer Segmentation:
- Segment customers based on demographics, behavior, or other relevant factors.
- Analyze persistency trends within each segment.

### Targeted Interventions:
- Develop targeted retention strategies for high-risk segments.
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation:

## Model Validation:
- Use appropriate metrics to assess model performance.
- Perform cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

### Model Interpretation:
- Interpret model coefficients or feature importance to understand the factors driving policy lapse.

## Visualizations:
- Create clear and informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
- Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization.

## Additional Considerations:
- Ethical Considerations: Ensure data privacy and confidentiality.
- Data Quality: Maintain data quality and consistency.
